# Machine_Learning_Model_for_prediction
This project is aimed to build a model based on machine learning which predicts certain information based on analysis of a dataset. For this project I am considering the case study, where the model predicts the loan amount that can be paid by the customer. To train the model, we use the following information  such as customer name, customer email, country, gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt to predict. This model is useful for many purposes such as  to know the eligible loan amount for a customer, based on that specific customer data knowing his age,  his annual salary, his credit card. Python programming is used for this project and is developed using anaconda software.
